***Research Question***: *How did the Twitter and parliamentary discourses about supplying weapons interact with each other and with the decisions to supply them?*

# Background
On 27 February 2022, only three days after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a major shift in Germany's security and defence policy, which he labelled as _Zeitenwende_, a historic turning point: _

_"We are living through a watershed era. And that means that the world afterwards will no longer be the same as the world before. The issue at the heart of this is whether power is allowed to prevail over the law. Whether we permit Putin to turn back the clock to the nineteenth century and the age of the great powers. Or whether we have it in us to keep warmongers like Putin in check. That requires strength of our own."_

As a consequence, he announced massive investments in the German military. At the same time, he overthrew the decades-old German foreign policy rule, reading: *no armaments to war zones*, by sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger missiles to Ukraine. This was the starting point for an increasing engagement of the German government in terms of weapons supply to Ukraine, leading to the delivery of more serious weapons over time: in April, Germany sent flak tanks as defensive weapons, in Mai howitzers were delivered and in June, Scholz announced the supply of the state-of-the-art air defense system Iris-T SLM. Despite this engagement, Scholz was criticized for being too hesitant in supporting Ukraine, too slow with his decisions on delivering weapons, and particularly combat tanks. The Chair of the Committee on European Union Affairs, Anton Hofreiter, for instance, already called for a supply of combat tanks in April 2022:

Similarly, Annalena Baerbock, the German Foreign Minister, publicly called for the supply of Leopard II combat tanks in mid-september (XX). These prominent figures were backed by an ongoing and rich discussion in the news, but importantly also on Twitter. Yet, it took until January 2023 that Scholz decided, after having convinced the US to supply tanks on their part, to free the way for German Leopard II tanks delivery to Ukraine. 

With this decision, the last taboo regarding supplying armaments to war zones was overcome and the major shift in the German Defence and Security Policy had come to a preliminary peak. 

In this project, we were interested in how different public discourses - namely the discourse on Twitter and the discourse in the German Bundestag - are related to the decisions: did the two discourses precedent or follow the decisions? And did Twitter or the German Bundestag set the direction of the discussion? These are the questions which we tried to answer in this project, summarized in the above mentioned research question. 

This report is structured as follows: First, we are going to give a brief overview of the theory in this field to then use it to derive three hypotheses which we want to test. Second, we describe the data we used, to then move on to the methods we deployed. After that we present the results and discuss the limitations, also sketching what future research could investigate in this question. The report ends with a conclusion.

# Theory
<ins>**Drawing on Agenda Setting . . .**<ins>

Our research questions is building on the literature about the political agenda and social media: what influences what? Political agenda setting is described as a "process by which some issues, but not others, attract political attention" (XX). While in older research agenda setting was mainly discussed with regard to traditional news media, the rise of social media has fundamentally changed the attention dynamics in the political sphere, actively playing an important role for the setting of the agenda: "political information cycles [nowadays] may involve greater numbers and a more diverse range of actors and interactions". For our field of interest, the issue mentioned in the definition is the supply of certain weapons to Ukraine, such that we are interested in how the discourses around supplying weapons on Twitter are related to the discourse in the German Bundestag and the actual decisions taken by the government. 

<ins>**. . . and Discursive Institutionalism**<ins>

A second strand of literature informing our project and complementing the literature on agenda setting is discursive institutionalism. It stresses two crucial ideas: first, that exogenous shocks may create a window of opportunity for path-breaking policy change (see also XX); and second that this policy change depends on the construction of public discussion (XX), which leads right back to the literature on agenda setting. We furthermore use discursive institutionalism's distinction between coordinative discourse, the horizontal discourse among political actors, and communicative discourse, the vertical discourse between political actors and citizens. The theory suggests that in simple polities, like the United Kingdom, communicative discourse is prevalent, while in compound polities, like Germany, coordinative discourse is stronger. Since our interest is on Germany, we derive the importance of the German coordinative discourse, i.e. the discourse of the main political actors with regard to the supply of weapons. 

# Hypotheses
From the theory outlined above and drawing on vote-seeking theories and the finding by Barbera et al that "legislators are more likely to follow, than to lead, discussion of public issues" (XX) we derive the following three hypotheses: 

> *H1: The supply of weapons is precedented by an increase in salience of the topic in the Bundestag.*
 
> *H2: The supply of weapons is precedented by an increase of approval of the delivery on Twitter.*

Furthermore, we are also interested in the dynamics between the discourse on Twitter and the discourse in the German Bundestag. 

> *H3: The increase in salience of the supply of weapons in the German Bundestag is precedented by the approval of the delivery on Twitter.*

# Data
To test our hypotheses, we used three main sources as data: Twitter, the plenary debates for the German Bundestag and the information on the German governmental decisions to supply weapons to Ukraine.
